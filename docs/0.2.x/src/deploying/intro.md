# Deploying

Perseus is a complex system, but we aim to make deploying it as easy as possible. This section will describe a few different types of Perseus deployments, and how they can be managed.

*Note: Perseus deployment is still under design and development, so this information in particular is subject to rapid change before v1.0.0.*
